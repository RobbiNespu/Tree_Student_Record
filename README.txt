Hi, this is my project for algorithm and data structure (BIC10404) course work.
Our finished project are very special! Guess what, we are using file i/o operation to store the data using tree travesal
then we manipulate in several ways. Enjoy!

# Task :
========
Write a program to implements trees in keeping 15 records of class members contains name and metric number. 
You're required to print in ascending order.

# Solution :
============
Well inorder travesal will sort out the data inorder for me :)

# P/s :
=======
You need to exit program from the option menu (Don't forcely terminate the terminal). 
So then the data in computer memory will be write back to file, the you can used it for future use.

Hi, this is my project for algorithm and data structure. 
But our project are very special! Guess what, we are using file i/o operation to store the data using tree travesal technique. Enjoy!

* Task :
========
Write a program to implements trees in keeping 15 records of class members contains name and metric number. You’re required to print in ascending order.


P/s : You need to exit program from the menu option. So then the data in computer memory will be write back to file for future use.
